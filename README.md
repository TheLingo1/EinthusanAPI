# EinthusanAPI

This is a program I wrote in Java that scrapes the indian movie website https://einthusan.tv and creates a local http server that processes requests and responds with data from the website. This was a maven project created in IntelliJ IDEA that is compiled to jar files. The server runs on the port 22222. 
The JSON, httpserver, and jsoup libraries were used in order to make this.
I primarily made this to learn about programming in Java and creating servers that interact with web-based front ends.
